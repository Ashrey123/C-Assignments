
1.How many arguments will be passed in Main method
Ans.In C#, the Main method can accept an array of strings as its argument, 
which represents command-line arguments passed to your program when it is executed. 
The number of elements in this array corresponds to the number of command-line arguments provided.

Here's the standard signature of the Main method:
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Your code here
}
In this method signature:

static: It indicates that the method is a static method and can be called without creating an 
instance of the class.
void: It indicates that the Main method does not return a value.
Main: This is the name of the method.
string[] args: This is the parameter that receives the command-line arguments.
The args parameter is an array of strings where each string represents a command-line argument.

The number of elements in the args array will be equal to the number of command-line arguments 
passed when you run the program. For example, if you run the program with the 
command MyProgram.exe arg1 arg2, the args array will have two elements: ["arg1", "arg2"].

You can access these command-line arguments inside the Main method to perform specific tasks or configurations based on the input provided when your program is executed.


2. REF AND OUT-
A ref parameter is used when you want to pass a reference to an existing variable to a method.
You must initialize the variable before passing it as a ref parameter.
The method can read and modify the value of the ref parameter.
The method must assign a value to the ref parameter before it returns.

void ModifyValue(ref int x)
{
    x = x * 2;
}

int value = 5;
ModifyValue(ref value);
// The 'value' variable is now 10

out Parameter:

An out parameter is used when you want to pass a reference to a variable, but the method is not required to initialize it before using it. The method is responsible for assigning a value to the out parameter.
Unlike ref, the variable passed as an out parameter doesn't need to be initialized before being passed to the method.
The method must assign a value to the out parameter before it returns.

void InitializeAndReturnOutValue(out int y)
{
    y = 10;
}

int result;
InitializeAndReturnOutValue(out result);
// The 'result' variable is now 10
